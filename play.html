        A Woman of no Importance

    <p>SCENE: _Sitting-room at Mrs. Arbuthnot’s_.  _Large open French window at back_,
        _looking on to garden_.  _Doors_ R.C. _and_ L.C.</p>

        <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6> 
        <p>[_Sitting down_.]</p> 
        <p>We came to inquire for your dear
            mother, Gerald. I hope she is better?</p>
    
        <h6>GERALD.</h6> 
        <p>My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton.</p>

        <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6> 
        <p>
            Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last
        night. I think there must have been thunder in the air. Or perhaps it
        was the music. Music makes one feel so romantic—at least it always gets
        on one’s nerves.
        </p>

        <h6>MRS. ALLONBY.</h6> 
        <p>It’s the same thing, nowadays.</p>

        <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6> 
        <p>I am so glad I don’t know what you mean, dear. I am
            afraid you mean something wrong. Ah, I see you’re examining Mrs.
            Arbuthnot’s pretty room. Isn’t it nice and old-fashioned?</p>
        <h6>
            MRS. ALLONBY.
        </h6>
           <p> [_Surveying the room through her lorgnette_.]</p> 
           <p>It looks quite the happy English home.</p>
        <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>
        <p> That’s just the word, dear; that just describes it.
            One feels your mother’s good influence in everything she has about her,
            Gerald.</p>

        <h6>MRS. ALLONBY.</h6>
        <p> Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that
            a good influence is the worst in the world.</p>

        <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6> 
        <p>When Lord Illingworth knows Mrs. Arbuthnot better he
            will change his mind. I must certainly bring him here.</p>

        <h6>MRS. ALLONBY.</h6> 
        <p>I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happy English
            home.</p>

        <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6> 
        <p>It would do him a great deal of good, dear. Most women
            in London, nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but
            orchids, foreigners, and French novels. But here we have the room of a
            sweet saint. Fresh natural flowers, books that don’t shock one, pictures
            that one can look at without blushing.</p>

        <h6>MRS. ALLONBY.</h6>
        <p> But I like blushing.</p>

        <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6> 
        <p>Well, there _is_ a good deal to be said for blushing,
            if one can do it at the proper moment. Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell
            me I didn’t blush nearly often enough. But then he was so very
            particular. He wouldn’t let me know any of his men friends, except those
            who were over seventy, like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way,
            was brought into the Divorce Court. A most unfortunate case.</p>

        <h6>MRS. ALLONBY.</h6> 
        <p>I delight in men over seventy. They always offer one the
            devotion of a lifetime. I think seventy an ideal age for a man.</p>

        <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>
        <p> She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn’t she?
            By-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see me more
            often now. You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don’t you?</p>

       <h6> GERALD. </h6>
       <p>I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth’s
        secretary.</p>

        <h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6> 
        <p>Surely not, Gerald! It would be most unwise of you.
            What reason can you have?</p>

        <h6>GERALD.</h6> 
        <p>I don’t think I should be suitable for the post.</p>

        <h6>MRS. ALLONBY.</h6> 
        <p>I wish Lord Illingworth would ask me to be his secretary.
            But he says I am not serious enough.</p>
