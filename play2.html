        <h6 class="name Lady_hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>  <p class="speech">My dear, you really mustn’t talk like that in this
        house.  Mrs. Arbuthnot doesn’t know anything about the wicked society in
        which we all live.  She won’t go into it.  She is far too good.  I
        consider it was a great honour her coming to me last night.  It gave
        quite an atmosphere of respectability to the party.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name allonby">MRS. ALLONBY.</h6> <p class="speech">Ah, that must have been what you thought was thunder in
        the air.</p> 
        
        <h6 class="name Lady_hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6> <p class="speech">My dear, how can you say that?  There is no resemblance
        between the two things at all.  But really, Gerald, what do you mean by
        not being suitable?</p>
